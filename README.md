Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

Can we use machine learning as a game-changer in this domain? Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.

stock price prediction, LSTM, machine learning we will work with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM. The above-stated machine learning algorithms can be easily learned from this ML Course online.

The core idea behind this article is to showcase how these algorithms are implemented. I will briefly describe the technique and provide relevant links to brush up on the concepts as and when necessary. In case you’re a newcomer to the world of time series, I suggest going through the following articles first:

Broadly, stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.

Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance. Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market. As you might have guessed, our focus will be on the technical analysis part. for this particular project, I have used the data for ‘Tata Global Beverages’. Time to dive in!
